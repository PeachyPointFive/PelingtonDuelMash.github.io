Play against a friend to see who who can click a key the fastest.

After pressing the big "Start" sign, it will give you a countdown, when it says "FIRE" it will start counting the clicks for the "A" and "L" keys.

After a random amount of time, it will stop counting, the clicks will be counted, and whichever side has the most clicks will win.

The "A" key and the "L" key respond to the Olive Cowboy and the Lilac Cowboy respectively.
